        <h1>Some Cool Projects</h1>
        <p>
            I've made some pretty swag projects
            throughout my time here! These
            are just a few:
       </p>
       <br>
       <ul>
            <li>
                <p>
                <h3>Belief in Sacrifice</h3>
                <img width=150px src="../Images/GameBeliefInSacrifice.png" alt="Belief in Sacrifice Game">
                <br>
                    Belief in Sacrifice was an open ended survival resource management game
                    made entirely in Java. The game is played through the console, with supplimental
                    images appearing on the side region. There's crafting, monsters, and secrets!
            </li>
       </p>
       <p>
            <li>
                <h3>Bullet Monster</h3>
                <img width=300px src="../Images/GameBulletMonster.png" alt="Bullet Monster Game">
                <br>
                Bullet Monster was a bullet-hell type game where you must survive
                endless storms of bullets trying to defeat monstrous bosses! There's three
                unique bosses to fight, and three alternate versions with much harder attacks!
            </li>
            
       </p>
       <p>
            <li>
                <h3>Bat Stomper</h3>
                <img width=300px src="../Images/GameBatStomper.png" alt="Bat Stomper Game">
                <br>
                Bat Stomper was a very small game coded entirely with a C++ engine created
                in-class. All you do is run around on the platform and stomp those bats!
            </li>
       </p>
       <p>
            <li>
            <h3>Modeling</h3>
            <img width=300px src="../Images/GameCpainModel.png" alt="A 3D Model">
            <br>
            We took a class about modeling objects and people in Maya. I was quite
            proud of my creation, so I thought I may as well put it here, too.
            </li>
       </p>
       </ul>
